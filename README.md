# customer_behavior_analysis
Data analysis project for analysing customer behavior using Python,MySql and Power BI

Data Analytics Project
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploration, cleaning, analysis using SQL, and visualization through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them in a clear, business-friendly format.

Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Python and stored locally.
It contains structured data suitable for exploratory data analysis and SQL querying.
Basic preprocessing and cleaning were required to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and data formatting.

Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
MySQL (SQL queries and analysis)
Power BI (Dashboard and visualizations)
Jupyter Notebook
Git/GitHub (Version control)

Project Steps
Data Loading
Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed data structure, distributions, and key patterns.
Identified trends, outliers, and relationships between variables.

Data Cleaning
Handled missing values and duplicates.
Standardized data types and column names.
Prepared clean data for analysis and reporting.

SQL Analysis (MySQL)
Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.
Wrote SQL queries to answer business and analytical questions.
Aggregated and filtered data for insights.

Dashboard Development
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard.
Visualized KPIs, trends, and key metrics.

Reporting
Created a structured report summarizing findings and insights.
Linked analysis results with dashboard visuals.

Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Trend analysis and comparisons
Interactive filters for deeper exploration

Results & Insights
Identified key trends and patterns in the data.
Highlighted actionable insights based on SQL queries and visual analysis.
Delivered a clear, data-driven summary suitable for business decision-making.
